# SocialMediaApp
This is a continuation of my social media group project. my current goals are 1. connect the signup button to automatically log the user in on the created profile, and navigate them to the home screen. 2. get user bio to store on the db instead of localstorage, call it back. 3. get friends lists to render onto user profile 4. store a profile pic
